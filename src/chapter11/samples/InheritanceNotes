1 - >	You can extend classes with another class using "extends" keyword

2 - >	If a class has "is a " releationship with another class , you should extend with that on the other hand 
		if class hasn't got a "is a" relationship , you shouldnt use this extend option just for using a few variables or methods.

3 - >	When you extend a class , you can use your super class methods and variables.

4 - >	You cant access private data fields but you can do it with accessors/mutators if defined in super class.

5 - >	You cant do multiple inheritence.

*Using the super Keyword
6 - >	You can access your super class constructors and methods from your subclass with "super" keyword.
		if you'd use super class's constructor , you need to write it at the first line of your subclass's constructor.
		
7 - >	Even if you dont call your super class constructor from your subclass's constructor , it automatically call your super class's no-arg constructor at first. 

*Constructor Chaining		
8 - >	Since its automatically call super class's no-arg constructor, chain work like : 
		firstly created extend class , lets say your super class has another extend class , 
		that another extend class's instance created first
		then your super class's instance
		then your class's instance.
		
9 - >	if your extend class doesn't have a no-arg constructor but another constructor that get parameter , that would be cause an error.

10 ->	To override a method, the method must be defined in the subclass using the same signature and the same return type as in its superclass
		An instance method can be overridden only if it is accessible Thus a private method cannot be overridden, because it is not accessible outside its own class.
		
11 ->	a static method can be inherited. However, a static method cannot be overridden.
