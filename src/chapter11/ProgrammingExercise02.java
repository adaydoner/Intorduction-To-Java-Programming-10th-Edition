/**
 * (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
 * Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address. 
 * A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. 
 * An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. 
 * A faculty member has office hours and a rank. 
 * A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the person’s name.
 * Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program
 * that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
