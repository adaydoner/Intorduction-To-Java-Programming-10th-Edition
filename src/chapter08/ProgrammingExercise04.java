/*
 * (Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
 * employees are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records an employeeâ€™s
 * seven-day work hours with seven columns. For example, the following
 * array stores the work hours for eight employees. Write a program that displays
 * employees and their total hours in decreasing order of the total hours.
