/*
 * (Find the number of days in a month) Write a program that prompts the user

 * example, if the user entered month 2 and year 2012, the program should display
 * that February 2012 had 29 days. If the user entered month 3 and year 2015, the
 * program should display that March 2015 had 31 days.
