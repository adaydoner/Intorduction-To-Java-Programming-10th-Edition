/*
 * (The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains:
 * 		A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
 * 		A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
 * 		A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate (default 0). Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
 * 		A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created.
 * 		A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
 * 		A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance.
 * 		The accessor(getters) and mutator(setters) methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate.
 * 		The accessor method for dateCreated.
 * 		A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate.
 * 		A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
 * 		A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
 * 		A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.
 * Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 * (Hint: The method getMonthlyInterest() is to return monthly interest, not the interest rate.
 * Monthly interest is balance * monthlyInterestRate. 
 * monthlyInterestRate is annualInterestRate / 12. Note that annualInterestRate is a percentage, e.g., like 4.5%. You need to divide it by 100.)
 * 
 * Write a test program that creates an Account object with an account ID of 1122, a balance of $20,000, 
 * and an annual interest rate of 4.5%. 
 * Use the withdraw  method to withdraw $2,500, 
 * use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, 
 * and print  the balance, the monthly interest, and the date when this account was created.
