/*
 * (Statistics: compute deviation) Programming Exercise 5.45 computes the standard
 * deviation of numbers. This exercise uses a different but equivalent formula to
 * compute the standard deviation of n numbers.
 * 		mean = sum(i to n)/n (xi +... + xn/n);
 * 		deviation = sqrt(sum(i to n) [(xi - mean)power of 2] / n - 1)
 * 
 * To compute the standard deviation with this formula, you have to store the individual
 * numbers using an array, so that they can be used after the mean is obtained. Your program should contain the following methods:
 * 
 * 		public static double deviation(double[] x)
 * 		public static double mean(double[] x) 
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter ten numbers and displays the  mean and standard deviation, as shown in the following sample run
